# DailyPlanner
### Live site at [DailyPlanner](https://cgsdesign.github.io/DailyPlanner/)
​
For this project I created a daily planner with editable hourly time slots that can be saved to local storage. The page utilizes Minute-JS, jQuery, jQuery-UI and Bootstrap as well as vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML. 
​
## Key Features
* Rewritable hourly task blocks 
* Local Storage utilized for task retention
* Various JS Libraries utilized
* Task time slots color coded based on relation to current time
* Task colors auto-refresh every 5 minutes
* Clear JS code organized by function and noted with internal documentation for easy reproducibility
